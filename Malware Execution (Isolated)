# Home Lab for Malware Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to set up a home lab using Oracle VirtualBox, 
featuring both Kali Linux and Windows 11 virtual machines. 
The lab will allow you to execute malware on the Windows 11 VM and capture its traffic using Wireshark on the Kali Linux VM. 
This project helps in learning about network security, analyzing malicious traffic, and enhancing defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Setting up and managing virtual environments.
- Analyzing network traffic with Wireshark.
- Executing and analyzing malware behavior.
- Understanding network security protocols and defense mechanisms.

### Tools Used

- Oracle VirtualBox for managing virtual machines.
- Kali Linux for network analysis and security tools.
- Windows 11 as the target system for malware execution.
- Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic.

### Step 3: Create and Configure Kali Linux VM

1. Open VirtualBox and click "New" to create a new virtual machine.
2. Name the VM "Kali Linux," set the type to "Linux," and version to "Debian (64-bit)".
3. Allocate at least 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of hard disk space.
4. Choose the downloaded Kali Linux ISO as the startup disk.
5. Follow the installation steps to complete the Kali Linux setup.

### Step 4: Create and Configure Windows 11 VM

1. Open VirtualBox and click "New" to create a new virtual machine.
2. Name the VM "Windows 11," set the type to "Microsoft Windows," and version to "Windows 10 (64-bit)".
3. Allocate at least 4 GB of RAM and 40 GB of hard disk space.
4. Choose the downloaded Windows 11 ISO as the startup disk.
5. Follow the installation steps to complete the Windows 11 setup.

### Step 5: Configure Network Settings

1. Set both VMs to use a Host-Only Adapter in the network settings to enable communication between them.
2. Ensure that the VMs are on the same network.

### Step 6: Install and Configure Wireshark on Kali Linux

1. Open a terminal in Kali Linux and run the following commands to install Wireshark:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install wireshark
   ```
2. Launch Wireshark and select the network interface connected to the Windows 11 VM.
